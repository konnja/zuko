; HERE YOU CAN SEE ZukoAIO CODE, TO USE IT YOU'LL HAVE TO DEACTIVATE WINDOWS DEFENDER AND DOWNLOAD IT, THEN LAUNCH IT.
; IT'S VIRUS FREE AS THE PROGRAM WAS MADE FOR SELF USAGE, THE SCRIPT IS WROTE IN AHK LANGUAGE.
; THE TBAG BUTTON IS SET AS "SPACEBAR" BUT IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO WHATEVER YOU LIKE, THE ACTIVATION IS "F1" AND TO STOP YOU JUST NEED TO PRESS "F2".
; THE RECOIL CONTROL IS PERSONAL BUT STILL WITH A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE PERSONALIZED, THE ACTIVATION BUTTON IS "CAPSLOCK" BUT YET YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO YOUR LIKING.
; TO MAKE THE RECOIL WORK MAKE SURE TO HAVE MOUSEBUTTON3, RIGHT CLICK TO AIM, PRESSED AND THEN HOLD DOWN THE MOUSEBUTTON1, LEFT CLICK TO SHOOT, AND THE JOB IS DONE.
; ENJOY!
